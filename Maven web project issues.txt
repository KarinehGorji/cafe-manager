*********not finding the dispatcher servlet


1- I was facing the same Issue. When I saw into maven repository .m2 folder
(....m2\repository\org\springframework\spring-webmvc) in my local I found two 3.2.0.RELEASE folders. 
SO I removed one. Then I went to project, right click->properties->deployment essembly-> add maven dependencies. 
clean build and then restart the server. Then the DispatcherServlet got loaded.
 
	

2- You need to add the "Maven Dependency" in the Deployment Assembly

    right click on your project and choose properties.
    click on Deployment Assembly.
    click add
    click on "Java Build Path Entries"
    select Maven Dependencies"
    click Finish.

Rebuild and deploy again
